/*
Create a function lastLetter that takes a word (string) and console.logs the last character/letter of that word.
Hint: Remember that each character/letter in a string has an index position that you can access with brackets: [] 

function lastLetter(word) {

return word.slice(-1);

}

//Uncomment the lines below to test your code
console.log(lastLetter("hello")); //=> "o"
console.log(lastLetter("goodbye!")); //=> "!"
console.log(lastLetter("ZeltoiD")); //=> "D"
